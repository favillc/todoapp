# About the Todo App
This is my first project with Angular. The goal was to build a simple frontend for a To do List web app, all as was requested by professor Andr√© Baltieri, from Balta.io portal.
As you can see, it's a simple (and pink) task list where you can:  
- add some task;
- mark said task as "done" or "undone";
- delete said task;

I hope you enjoy, this is a start for me and I'm happy with the outcome.
